Predicting_Heart_Disease_using_SVM
Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration

Import the neccessary libraries
Load the heart disease dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explore the data using methods like head(), info(), and describe() to understand its structure and characteristics.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships.
Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
Identify patterns and potential insights related to heart disease diagnosis.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values, if any, by imputing or removing them.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding. -Remove unnecessary columns that won't be used in the SVM model.

Step 4: Feature Selection
Choose relevant features for predicting heart disease.
Consider the impact of each feature on the prediction task.
Decide whether to use all features or a subset based on domain knowledge.

Step 5: Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Common splits include 70-30 or 80-20 for training and testing, respectively.

Step 6: Feature Scaling
Standardize or normalize the feature values to ensure they are on the same scale.
Scaling is essential for SVM as it relies on distances between data points.
The Radial Basis Function (RBF) that we are using with our Support Vector Machine assumes that the data are centered and scaled, so we need to do this to both the training and testing datasets.

Step 7: SVM Model Building
Create an SVM model for classification.
Choose the appropriate SVM kernel (e.g., linear, polynomial, or radial basis function).
Initialize the model with hyperparameters like C (regularization parameter) and kernel-specific parameters.

Step 8: Model Training
Train the SVM model on the training data.
The model learns to differentiate between patients with and without heart disease based on the features.
Step 9: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the SVM model's performance on the testing data:
Calculate classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
Visualize results through ROC curves and precision-recall curves.
Use cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
